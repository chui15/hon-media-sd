      'Hon Media came in and offered to help us when we opened during the Pandemic. Thanks to them, we have gotten a clear view of the market environment and have a clear marketing strategy to move forward. They also helped us with developing a content strategy and promotions to grow our presence on Instagram and Facebook. Their quality of work and professionalism is of the best that I have worked with. I would recommend Hon Media to any organization fortunate enough to work with them.',

      "The Design Lab has partnered with Hon Media for the last three years. During that time they have produced weekly Design Thinking speaker talks and video campaigns with the goal of increasing the Design Labâ€™s exposure to the San Diego Regional Design community. Hon Media collaborated on the production of the Design for San Diego (D4SD) Civic Design Challenges film, where they worked with Design Lab Faculty to craft the narrative and visual story of the film. The finished film was presented at the D4SD event, attended by California Congressman Scott Peters, the Mayor of San Diego, the UC San Diego Chancellor, and regional Design Industry executives. Another high-profile project Hon Media contributed to was the production of the 14-minute Pepper Canyon Mobility Hub Designathon video, showcasing the Design Lab's Human-Centered Design approach, partnerships, and philosophy. Hon Media has consistently demonstrated their knowledge of narrative storytelling, social media strategy, collaboration, and knowledge of human-centered design.",
